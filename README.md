### Random quotes on demand

An example I created to teach some friends how to:

1. Use an external API
2. Provide basic styling and
3. Directly manipulate the DOM (for ease).

May refactor later for React, Vue or orther modern alternative.

Concept is simple enough that an alternative API can easily replace the current one.
